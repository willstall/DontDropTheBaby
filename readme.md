# Don't Drop the Baby! [Play it!](https://willstall.github.io/DontDropTheBaby/) 
This tiny little nugget of happiness was created solo entirely on an iPad in just under 24hrs for Philadelphia's Yearly Game Jam in 2018. The theme of this particular jam was Parenting. I am obviously a terrible parent.

## Tools
I created this game using just an iPad over the course of 24hrs. One of the major hurdles was debugging, so my very first task was to create a quake-style drop-down javascript debugger so I could execute code and see errors.

## Scaffold
I love using [CreateJS](https://github.com/CreateJS/CreateJS) for these tiny little projects, but I also don't love starting from nothing, [heres my Scaffolding](https://github.com/willstall/CreateJSScaffold)

## iPad Programs

I used [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com) for both testing and GIT access, while all my art was created in [Assembly](http://assemblyapp.co).
